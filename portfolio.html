              Eat-Da-Burgaaah is a restaurant app that lets users input the
              names of burgers they'd like to eat. The inputted burgers will be
              on the right of the screen, the eaten burgers will be on the left.
              The user has many options with the burgers, they can eat it or
              delete it if their taste changes and they no longer wish to have
              that burger as an option. Once eaten the user can select to have
              that burger be available to eat again, because who can stop with
              eating just one delicious burger, or delete it. If the user wants
              to add their favorite burger they have the power and are
              encouraged to do so. They will have the option to eat it right
              away or put it on the list of burgers to eat and they can consume
              it at their leisure.

              This simple calendar application will allow a user to save events
              for each hour of the day. The hours presented represent "normal
              business hours", 9am to 5pm. The calendar will allow the user to
              input text and have the option to save what is inputted. The
              calendar is color coded for the user to know what hour it
              currently is, what hours have past, and hours still available. A
              key has been rendered to aid the user to understand the color
              code.

              The Recipe App is a great resource to help get new recipe ideas,
              share recipes, and add recipes that will satisfy not only your
              belly but get you out of the dark ages and have these recipes at
              the tip of your finger. No more searching through old cookbooks or
              rummaging around trying to find grandmas super secret recipe thats
              written on an index card. Only to find it with the ink faded and
              you having to guess if grandma was using 1/2 cup of apple slices
              or 1/2 a cup of apple spice. By all means go ahead and take that
              step and make the call, just add the recipe to the Recipe App so
              you don't have to wonder again next time.
