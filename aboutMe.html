          <p class="intro">I was in the Navy for 6 years as a Fire Controlman and was in charge of maintaining and
            operating CIWS on FFG-42 USS Klakring. I've traveled all around Europe and South America and am tired of the
            ocean so don't ask me to go on a cruise because I will decline faster than you can ask me. After the
            military I went to school to become an Xray Tech, and worked fulltime doing that for a little over 3 years.
            I have 4 amazing crazy kids, 3 girls and 1 boy. I'm going on 13 years being married to my amazing and
            supporting wife. We have 1 dog named Bentley, who is 11 and just as crazy as my kids. In my freetime I enjoy
            playing with my kids, which primarily involves them beating me up; playing xbox, keeping up to date with
            sports, playing basketball, working out, and cooking.</p>
